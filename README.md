# DNS-Autoupdate

### Motivation
If you want to have your on web server, for example, in your Raspberry Pi with a custom domain, at least in Spain, you need to pay to your ISP for a static IP or update the DNS when the IP change.

For this reason I made a NodeJS script that you can program the execution with a crontab and automatically check if your public IP is diferent of the one in the DNS record and if it is it changes it.

## Install and use

**You need Node.js ([for Windows, Mac or Linux](https://nodejs.org/en/), for [Raspberry Pi](http://weworkweplay.com/play/raspberry-pi-nodejs/)) for running this.**

Download the [last release](https://github.com/SantiMA10/DNS-Autoupdate/releases), unzip it and download all the dependencies with **npm install**.

Now have to run the **"auth.js"** script on **"/services/{service name}/"**, for example: "/service/ovh/auth.js", and get a link to authorize the app, if you want to program the execution I recomend to set the **Validity** on **Unlimited**.

Once you visit the link and now you can run it using **node app.js** or program the execution with CronTab.
